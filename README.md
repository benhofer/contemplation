# Contemplation App

App for aiding in contemplative prayer. 

This is a collaboration based on an app built by [Alex Poulos](https://github.com/mapoulos), which he asked me to build a new frontend for. 

# Running the App

This app was built using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)

To run the app locally, first run `npm install`, then `npm start`
